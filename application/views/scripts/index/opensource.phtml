                Hi Technion students, My name is Yariv Katz I studied at Technion university and have  my B.SC degree in computer science. After expriancing the problems with the refernce world i decided to create nerdeez as a solution to all the complaints i heard over the years. Since nerdeez was created it grew popular among technion students and collected more than 40GB of knowledge files and quite an impressive traffic. what began as an experiment project is now starting to feel like a tool students need not only in the technion but maybe the world. Itâ€™s this thought, thousands of ideas for the site, and lack of manpower to create them, and with the strong feeling that abandoning this project is something that might harm students needs I decided to move this project to the open source community, knowing that if it became not a personal project of my company but rather a university project that all technion students can fork the code from git work a week on a new feature like adding a calender or a wall to the site or debugging  a bug that annoys them if it became a tool developed by the community it can become a very powerfull tool for students world wide.
So with that said i invite you to start expending your knowledge about web application programming, expand your creativity by adding features you think will be popular among technion students and participate in the first open source university web application.

        </h1>
        <div style="">
            <p>
                the site code was designed for open source in a way that the code is modular, easily extended and easy to add new features without interacting to much with the old code. The site was built using Zend Framework which is the most popular open source php MVC framework. designing the site in a MVC way made the site code clean, understandable easily maintained and very easy to add new features. Adding a new feature is only a matter of adding a new controller, view and a model and can easily be done by students without learning all the code that was written. The code is also well documented and a full project doc is available for all the students that want to participate in the project. Also i will be happy to sit talk and explain about the code to any new developer, In my opinion this project is a real upportunaty to every developer to learn how to create a professional web application and sit with an exprianced web developer.
